## Methane Emission Analysis

1. **Collected and Cleaned Data**:
   - Gathered methane emission data from various sources and cleaned it using **Pandas** to ensure accuracy. This involved handling missing values, filtering outliers, and normalizing the dataset for structured analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted EDA using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize trends and patterns. Created bar charts, scatter plots, and line graphs to explore variations in methane emissions across time, sectors, and regions.

3. **Comparison Across Sectors and Regions**:
   - Analyzed methane emissions by sector (agriculture, energy, waste) and region to highlight significant differences and trends. Identified key contributors to methane emissions.

4. **Summarized Findings**:
   - Compiled findings into clear visual reports, presenting key insights and trends to provide a comprehensive overview of the methane emission landscape.

This approach ensured that the data was effectively communicated, aiding in the understanding of emission patterns.
